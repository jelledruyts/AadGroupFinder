<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
    This application was built out of the simple frustration that it's often too hard to find discussion lists on a certain topic.
</p>
<p>
    In the spirit of the growth mindset &mdash; and because all the necessary components are available in the magic of
    the <a href="https://www.azure.com/">cloud</a> &mdash; we set out to provide a simple but effective solution.
</p>
<p>
    With this application, you can't just search for groups based on name and description, but also on community-provided
    annotations (notes and tags). This way, we can all help each other find the most relevant groups.
</p>
<p>
    We also wanted to make it easier to find relevant groups, based on shared membership of certain people or groups.
</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
    Using the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-graph-api/">Azure AD Graph API</a>,
    a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-create-web-jobs/">WebJob</a>
    hosted in an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/">Azure Web App</a>
    processes <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-differential-query">differential queries</a>
    to synchronize the mail-enabled groups into an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search/">Azure Search</a> index.
</p>
<p>
    An <a href="http://www.asp.net/core">ASP.NET Core</a> Web API that is hosted in the same Azure Web App
    uses the Azure AD Graph API and the Azure Search index to expose the core functionality to its client applications.
</p>
<p>
    The web application you are using right now is an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> based Single-Page Application
    written in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> that signs you in to the corporate directory and allows
    you to work with the Web API to easily and quickly find what you are looking for...
